*Realized by [Axel](https://github.com/axelriv62), [Quentin](https://github.com/quentinltg), and
[Jules](https://github.com/roulio-dev), first-year students (year 23-24) in BUT Computer Science
at IUT Lens.*

###### Except for the README files, the project is presented as it was submitted in January 2024.

## Presentation

This project was realized as part of a SAE ('Learning and Assessment Situation' in French) during the
first semester of the BUT in Computer Science. The objective was to design a static website for a
fictitious company in the event industry.

Abyss Explore is a company specialising in the organisation of scuba diving trips, offering unforgettable 
experiences to underwater exploration enthusiasts.

<br>

## Approach and Research

The project included in-depth reflection and research steps, requiring us to:

1. Analyze the needs: creation of personas and conducting surveys among our peers.
2. Study the competition: analysis of two competitors, followed by a SWOT analysis.
3. Develop a visual identity: design of a branding guideline and a website mockup.

We also had to address several technical constraints:

- Use forms and translate a page into English.
- Comply with W3C standards to ensure accessibility.
- Verify the ecological impact of the site using the Muchas Glacias tool.

<br>

## Areas for Improvement

At the end of the project, we would have liked to have more time to:

- Make the site responsive so that it can be viewed on all types of screens.
- Integrate animations to enhance the user experience.
- Translate the entire site into English for international accessibility.
